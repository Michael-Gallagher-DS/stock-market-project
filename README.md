Created a SQL database containing over 8 years of historical pricing data for 500+ US equities and ETFs. The database includes 15 custom features for technical analysis and is updated daily after market close powered by PythonAnywhereâ€™s task scheduler. The database serves as the backbone for the automated reporing and backtesting tools.

## Database
A comprehensive financial database powered by MySQL and Python, housing 8+ years of historical market data for more than 500 US stocks and ETFs. The system leverages PythonAnywhere's scheduling capabilities to refresh the data after each trading day.

## Automated Daily Reporting
Developed a robust reporting system that delivers market-wide performance insights and actionable trade ideas in a concise, three-part format. The report is automatically emailed at the end of each trading, following the update of the stock market database.

## Backtesting Tool
The backtesting tool utilizes the stock market database for pricing data and technical indicators in conjunction with the backtesting.py library. This framework supports in-depth backtesting of trading strategies and associated metrics (win-rate, P&L, ROI, etc).

## Position Sizing GUI
Designed an easy to use GUI that streamlines trade position sizing and risk management. Relying on only 3 user inputs, this tool increases trade entry speed by 2-3x while eliminating the risk of manual calculation errors.
